    "This function, count_words_in_file, is like a word detective scanning a file for specific terms you care about. Here’s how it works, step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Purpose\n",
    "It counts how many times each word from a given list appears in a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters\n",
    "* **filename:** The name of the text file to read.\n",
    "* **word_list:** A list (array) of words you want to count in that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-step Breakdown\n",
    "### 1.  Initialize Word Counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "word_count = {word.lower(): 0 for word in word_list}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a dictionary where each word from your list is a key (converted to lowercase for consistency), and its value starts at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Open File Safely:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Tries to open the file in read mode using UTF-8 encoding. If it doesn't exist, it throws a FileNotFoundError, which is handled later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Read the File Line by Line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for line in file:\n",
    "    words = line.lower().split()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each line is converted to lowercase and then split into individual words (based on whitespace).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Count Target Words:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for word in words:\n",
    "    if word in word_count:\n",
    "        word_count[word] += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "For every word in that line, it checks if it's in the word_count dictionary. If so, it increments the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Handle Missing File:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(f\"File '{filename}' not found.\")\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the file isn’t found, it prints a friendly message and exits gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Return the Final Tally:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "return word_count\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "After reading the whole file, it returns the dictionary with word counts.\n",
    "\n"
